# GeeksforGeeks Problem of the Day (POTD) Progress

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I track my daily progress on GeeksforGeeks' **Problem of the Day (POTD)** challenges! I upload a screenshot of each day's completion as part of my journey to stay consistent and improve my problem-solving skills.

## 📅 Current Streak: 31 Days

I am committed to solving a GFG POTD every day, and I will continue to upload my progress as long as my streak remains unbroken. If my streak breaks, I'll pick up right where I left off and keep pushing forward.

## 🔍 What is GeeksforGeeks POTD?

The **Problem of the Day** is a daily coding challenge provided by GeeksforGeeks (GFG) that helps users improve their problem-solving abilities. The problems vary in difficulty and cover a wide range of computer science concepts, providing an excellent opportunity for continuous learning.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

- **Track my consistency:** I use this repo to motivate myself by maintaining a record of my streak.
- **Showcase my journey:** Each screenshot reflects my progress, dedication, and commitment towards improving my coding skills.
- **Encourage others:** If you're also working on your GFG POTD streak, feel free to follow along and stay motivated!

## 🗂 Repository Structure

- Each screenshot is organized by day.
- Naming convention: `POTD-DD-MM-YYYY.png`
  

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Continue uploading my POTD screenshots daily.
- Add solutions to the problems in a separate directory for future reference.
- Share tips and approaches for solving specific types of problems.
