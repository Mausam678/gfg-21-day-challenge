To sum it all up, streaming the 21-day POTD run by Deutsche Bank was a transformative and highly fulfilling experience. During this journey, I came across quite a few gruelling problems in C++ consisting of, 'Middle of Linked List' ,'Mirror Tree',' Binary Tree to DLL' ,'Longest Valid Brackets' ,'Missing and Duplicate Numbers'. Solving such problems helped me explore the realms of core DS', linked list, binary tree, dynamic programming and the optimization salty water that touches the shores of the ever complex algorithms that manipulate strings.

Writing the solutions to problems like 'Clone linked list with next pointer and random pointer', 'Smallest window in string' etc not only helped me hone my problem solving skills, it also helped me understand the significance of writing extremely optimized code and instilled a good base of algorithms in me and forced me into writing codes that followed the best practices. 

Post finishing the 21 day challenge, I decided to make amends. The 'Daily problems' still come and every day is a new day where I look forward on a problem to work on to. I strongly think that I will go on to do this for as long as I can and use this for a long term commitment to self improvement. This habit of continuous learning has made me improve. It has made me confident about tackling difficult problems in computing and most importantly the uncertainty of where I can apply my knowledge gained through this experience, puts me in a good position regarding interviews or for dealing with scenarios at work. In a nut shell, this has helped me grow technically advanced and have bestowed upon me a state of mind that will make me disciplined, push me to grow to be better every day and give me the attitude of perseverance. 

I thank Deutsche Bank for providing me with this opportunity to grow and I look forward to using the knowledge aggrend through this challenge to tackle future race horses
